Simple 2D Platformer game created with Unity <br>
The game uses Unity's Platformer Microgame Template (https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-platformer-template) as a base but many of the templates original components have been revamped or overhauled <br>
Some game sprites are taken from the Sunny Land asset pack found here (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/sunny-land-103349)
